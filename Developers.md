## Notes

Quite a lot of heavy machinery has been deployed for some pretty simple needs here (`redux-persist`, `react-hook-form`, etc.). This means it could in theory be much lighter and faster.

One goal of this project is to serve as a low-risk, not-totally-useless playground for experimenting and getting experience with the latest and greatest in the TS/React ecosystem that is not just a dumb hello-world no one actually uses.

So chill, it's not really ridiculous over-engineering :-).

If you have some cool thing that might be cool to try out, send a PR!
