# GenreTV

This project is an attempt to give the legendary genretv.blotspot.com superpowers.

It separates the presentation and functionality from the data, which is housed [in a separate repo](/genretv/data).

You can (via the settings button on the top right):

- Configure your own Data and Update Log URLs, meaning in theory you could have you own lists.
- Add _extra_ Data URLs and have the entries merged using `lodash` `merge`.
- Validate the JSON in [the data repo](/genretv/data)
- Other stuff that we implement...
